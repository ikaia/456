# Submission 

Make sure URLs begin with the secure protocol: https://
 - When submitting your assignment link, make sure that it begins with https://
 - Never submit a link that starts with something else.
 - For instance, file:// refers to a local file on your personal computer and will not link to your server space.

When Off Campus, you must enable your Purdue VPN to do any of the following:

Network drive location for mapping the server drive:
**\\ecniisdev.ecn.purdue.edu\cgt456**

--
      -**use your BoilerAD\ and your career account login and password**
      -there should be a txt file in there with your name, that is your password file

To view your assignment in a web browser after you have saved it to the server:
https://cgtweb2.tech.purdue.edu/courses/cgt356/yourFolderName/Assign01/assign01.html
      -Notice cgt356 in the URL
      -yourFolderName would be replaced with your folder name, i.e. your career account username (usually)

URL to submit assignment links:
https://cgtweb2.tech.purdue.edu/courses/cgt356/rjglotz/classApps/SubmitAssignment/index.php
      -use the login and password I created for you, check your password file

URL to navigate to MySQL PhpMyAdmin:
https://engineering.purdue.edu/phpMyAdmin/
      -choose goss
      -use the login and password I created for you, check your password file

# Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio and make sure you are ready to go before Week 2 starts

You can download Visual Studio Community from:&nbsp;
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

During the install, it will ask you what workloads you want to install, I chose in *Visual Studio Installer*:

**ASP.NET and Web Development**
**.NET desktop development (Node.js)** (we will do some of this)
**Data Storage and processing**
We are off and running using Visual Studio in the next assignment. Make sure that you have it installed or have access to a computer with it installed (with all the necessary workloads).
Visual Studio for Mac is not the same as Visual Studio for Windows. You will be frustrated and disappointed trying to run VS for Mac and complete assignments. Either talk with somebody about how to get dual boot setup so you can install Windows and Visual Studio for Windows or find a Windows computer that you can use Visual Studio on. If you went off it, you can go to Visual Studio Installer > Modify > .NET FRAMEWORKS. 
I suggest you use 2022. That's what I will be using. That is what is installed in the lab. Lastly, check the **checkboxes**: 
Also,
>NET.FRAMEWORKS
- **NET.Frameworks 0.1**
- **NET.Frameworks 0.3**
- **NET.Frameworks 0.4**

Then once you in, go to search box enter: **ASP.NET Web Application C# (.NET FRAMEWORK)**
>Finally, you go to file > new > project > asp net form (globe) > Assign01 > Add Item (Right-Click) > Web Form > Assign01.aspx (Yay!)

Tips: 
Tools bar (wait 5 mintues)
View > Soultion Explorer > Files (Sidebar ex: Assign01)
Build > Build Soultion > Output (See Code Frontend)
*Mouse clicker being werid if you want it to defulat normal press: INSERT*
